# webscraping_multiple_pages
 We’ll scrape the first 4 pages of each year in the interval 2000-2017. 4 pages for each of the 18 years makes for a total of 72 pages. Each page has 50 movies, so we’ll scrape data for 3600 movies at most. But not all the movies have a Metascore, so the number will be lower than that. Even so, we are still very likely to get data for over 2000 movies.
